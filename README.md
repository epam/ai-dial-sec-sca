# ai-dial-sec-sca

Composite GitHub Actions that run the software composition analysis (SCA) scan of AI DIAL repositories: [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) finds known vulnerabilities in every target, [OSV](https://osv.dev/) then checks the language packages Trivy found plus, for image targets, the image itself (its OS packages included), and the results are merged into one report.

These actions are called by the `sca_scheduled.yml` workflow of [epam/ai-dial-ci](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-ci). They are not meant to be used directly: repositories call that workflow, which orchestrates the scan and the actions below.

## Actions

- `actions/sca_resolve_targets`: builds the list of scan targets and resolves the releases: the default branch source, the source of each release of the release set, and, per image, `development` and the same release tags. The release set is the newest patch of each of the last `release-lines` (default 2) minor lines (`X.Y.Z` tags of non-prerelease, non-draft GitHub releases), plus at most one candidate. The candidate is the newest prerelease (by version, `X.Y.Z-pre`) whose base version is greater than the newest stable; a prerelease of an already published version is not scanned. A stable release whose tag is not `X.Y.Z` is left out of the set and counted in one notice. The release listing is read page by page (up to 1000 releases). Inputs: `scan-tag` focuses the run on one git tag (its source and the tag in every image, no `development`); `osv-image-scan` is the repository's own setting that switches the direct OSV image scan off; `force-image-scan` runs that scan anyway (a manual run) and marks the run with `forced_image_scan` in `targets.json` and `report.json`. Pass `osv-image-scan` as the repository sets it, not combined with the force flag: the action does the combining.
- `actions/sca_query_osv`: checks the language packages found by Trivy against OSV with osv-scanner; an image target also gets a direct `osv-scanner scan image`, which reads the image's own package database and so checks its OS packages against OSV correctly (a BOM cannot: OSV keys its records by the source package name). The BOM query runs either way, so a package either detector sees keeps its OSV check. The action installs Trivy from the aquasecurity/trivy GitHub release of `trivy-version` (a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z`, else the action fails). The sha256 of the release archive is pinned in the engine per version (`v0.75.0`, Linux-64bit and Linux-ARM64); the `checksums.txt` of the release is not trusted alone. Another version needs the optional input `trivy-sha256` (the sha256 of the archive of the runner's architecture), else the action fails. The install is cached by version, OS and architecture; the cache keeps the archive, which is verified and unpacked again on every run, so a restored cache is not trusted. Optional input `offline-db-dir`: a directory with the osv-scanner offline databases that the caller downloaded beforehand (the engine never downloads them). Given, the action sets `OSV_SCANNER_LOCAL_DB_CACHE_DIRECTORY` to it and runs both scans (BOM and image) with `--offline`, which also switches off the other network features of osv-scanner. An osv-scanner run that reports `no offline version of the OSV database` on stderr fails its target whatever the exit code, with the stderr tail as the reason. Empty (the default): nothing changes. A target of `targets.json` may carry `image_scan_disabled_reason` next to `image_scan_disabled`; it is then the reason shown for the skipped image scan.
- `actions/sca_merge_results`: normalizes the Trivy and OSV reports, merges them into `report.json` and writes the `summary.md` job summary (see below). Optional input `engine-ref` (or the environment variable `SCA_ENGINE_REF`, or the `--engine-ref` argument of `merge_results.py`) sets the `engine` field of the report. The order is the argument, then the environment variable, then the ref the action runs from (`ACTION_PATH`), else `null`. Empty (the default): nothing changes.
- `actions/_install_trivy`: installs Trivy from the GitHub release of `version` (same rules and the same optional `trivy-sha256` as in `sca_query_osv`); `sca_query_osv` repeats its steps and shares its `install.sh`, because a composite action cannot use a sibling action by a relative path.
- `actions/generate_gradle_lockfiles`: generates Gradle lockfiles on the fly so Trivy can resolve Gradle dependencies (repository files are not modified).
- `actions/sca_fix_plan` and `actions/sca_fix_apply`: the fixer, see Fixer below.

The actions share the code in `actions/_sca_lib` (it is imported through `PYTHONPATH=${{ github.action_path }}/..`, so the `actions/` layout must stay as it is).

## Inputs

The inputs of every action are in its `action.yml`; these are the ones a caller sets.

`sca_resolve_targets`:

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `repository` | none (required) | The repository (owner/name) whose code is scanned and whose releases are resolved. |
| `registry` | `ghcr.io` | The container registry the images are pulled from. |
| `images` | empty | Image names without registry, one per line; empty means a source scan only. |
| `release-lines` | `2` | How many of the newest minor release lines are scanned, plus the newest candidate. |
| `scan-tag` | empty | Focus the run on one git tag instead of the release set. |
| `osv-image-scan` | `true` | The repository's own switch of the direct OSV image scan. |
| `force-image-scan` | `false` | Run the OSV image scan although the repository switched it off (a manual run). |

`sca_query_osv`:

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `targets-file`, `parts-dir`, `output-dir` | none (required) | The `targets.json` of the resolver, the Trivy parts, the folder of the OSV parts. |
| `trivy-version` | none (required) | The Trivy release tag (for example `v0.75.0`) installed from the GitHub release. |
| `offline-db-dir` | empty | The osv-scanner offline databases, downloaded by the caller; given, both scans run with `--offline`. |

`sca_merge_results`:

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `targets-file`, `parts-dir`, `output-dir` | none (required) | The `targets.json`, the scan parts of both scanners, the folder of `report.json` and `summary.md`. |
| `trivy-db-info` | empty | The Trivy DB snapshot of the run as JSON; empty means unknown. |
| `engine-ref` | empty | The ref stated as `engine` in the report; empty means the ref the action runs from. |

Optional keys of `targets.json` that the caller may add before the merge (the resolver does not write them):

| Key | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `acceptances` | list of rules | Risk acceptance rules of the caller (see Acceptance rules). |
| `version_kinds` | object, ref to kind | The kind of a version whose ref is not a semver tag (see `versions[]`). |
| `image_scan_disabled_reason` | string, on a target | The reason shown for a skipped OSV image scan (next to `image_scan_disabled`). |

`sca_fix_plan` (`reports`, `config`, `output-dir`) and `sca_fix_apply` are described under Fixer.

## Job summary

`summary.md` is organized by version (a branch or a release tag), because a fixer needs to know what to bump where. Only two tables and the version headings are visible; everything else is collapsed. The numbers come from `versions[]` of `report.json`, so the summary and the report agree.

- `Vulnerabilities`: one row per scanned version (`development` first, then releases from the newest) with the vulnerabilities by severity (`versions[].counts`) and how many have a fix (`Fixable`). A version whose scan failed shows what its `ok` targets found and is marked `(partial)`, as is `All (unique)` when any version failed. The last row, `All (unique)`, counts a vulnerability once however many versions have it, at its worst severity.
- `Packages to update`: the same rows with the vulnerable libraries by their worst severity, the vulnerable OS packages and how many packages have a fix. A package in several versions counts once in the last row.
- A section per version with its libraries and base image OS packages, each in a collapsed table. A package seen in the source and in the images of one version is one row, with `Seen in` naming where (`src` or the image name, each listed once). A row lists at most 5 vulnerability ids, then `+N more`; the whole list is in `report.json`. Rows with a fix come first, development-only packages (marked `dev`) after the others, packages with no fix last, then by severity.
- `Ignore file`: the audit of the `.trivyignore` lines (expired, without expiry, with a bad date, matching nothing). When the file was not read, a line under the header says why (`Risk acceptance not applied: ...`); a run focused on one tag says nothing.
- `Scan details by target`: the status of every scan, including the failed and not applicable ones.
- Health warnings under the header: the Trivy DB is older than 48 hours at the time of the report, or an `ok` Trivy target scanned no packages.

Marks after a vulnerability id, in brackets:

- `new in DB`: the vulnerability was published at most 14 days before the run.
- `accepted until D`: a `.trivyignore` line or an acceptance rule of the caller accepts it until `D` (see Risk acceptance).
- `fixed in X`: on a release or a release candidate older than the newest release `X`: none of the names of the vulnerability is found in `X` (same class; the package name does not count, so a renamed package is not a fix). Shown only when both versions have the same targets, all their Trivy scans are `ok` and none scanned 0 packages.

A package is not fixable when none of its vulnerabilities has a fixed version. If only some have one, it counts as fixable and `Fixed` lists the versions that exist.

## Fixer

The fixer turns the schema 4 reports into pull requests that bump the vulnerable packages of the newest release lines. The `sca_fix.yml` reusable workflow of [epam/ai-dial-ci](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-ci) runs the two actions; they are not meant to be called on their own.

- `actions/sca_fix_plan` (input `reports`: the `report.json` files of one repo; `config`: the policy as JSON; `output-dir`): plans which records of which versions become fix items, with the target version and the method (`dependabot`, `npm-override`, opt-in `docker-tag`; anything else is `manual` with a reason code). It writes `fix-plan.json` (schema 2) and `fix-plan.md`. A pure function of the reports and the configuration: no network, no git.
- `actions/sca_fix_apply` (input `command`: `apply`, `publish`, `node` or `summary`): `apply` runs the automated items of one plan line on a checked-out branch (Dependabot CLI jobs, the npm override step, the base image bump) and proves each change with a rescan by the same detector as the scan (Trivy and OSV from one database state, records built by `records_of` of the engine); `publish` pushes the fix branch the fixer owns and opens or updates one pull request; `node` reads the node version of a branch; `summary` writes the job summary of all lines.

`sca_fix_plan` is also an installable package (`actions/sca_fix_plan`, standard library only, no side effects on import, `__version__` 1.0.0) with this public API:

- `build_plan(reports, config)`: the fix plan (`reports` from `merge_reports`, `config` from `parse_config`).
- `classify(...)`: the state of every record in the planned lines: fixed, removed or open in development, or incomplete data.
- `upgrade_target(installed, records, dev_versions=(), allow_major="none")`: the target version the plan rule gives for one installed version of a package, as `(target, evidence, reason_code)`. `records` are the records of that package; the required version is the highest over the records of their lowest fixed version above `installed`; the target is the lowest development version at or above it, else the lowest fixed version at or above it, in the major of `installed` (`allow_major="dev-proven"` also takes a development version of another major). Without a target, `target` is `None`, `evidence` the reason and `reason_code` one of `no_fixed_version`, `needs_major` or `version_unparsable` (a version that cannot be compared is returned, not raised). `build_plan` uses the same rule, so the two cannot differ.

## Tests

```sh
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pytest test/sca test/fix_plan test/fix_apply
```

The tests need Python 3.12 and no network access. They run in GitHub Actions on every push and pull request to `main`.

## report.json

`sca_merge_results` writes `report.json` (`schema_version` 4):

- the header: `engine` (the ref of `sca_merge_results` as the runner resolved it: a tag, a branch or a commit SHA; `null` outside GitHub Actions), `repo`, `commit_sha`, `default_branch`, `run_id`, `run_attempt`, `run_url`, `generated_utc`, `event`, `actor`, and, when set, `scan_ref` and `forced_image_scan`;
- `tools`: the versions of Trivy and osv-scanner, the Trivy DBs and the OSV query time;
- `targets[]`: every target with its `status` (`ok`, `failed`, `not_applicable`) and `packages_scanned`; a Trivy image target also has `os` (`{family, name, eosl}` from the Trivy result, `eosl` true for an end-of-life distribution; `null` when the scan has no OS data: failed, `not_applicable`, source targets), the OSV entry does not; the Trivy and the OSV scan of a target are two entries with one id;
- `findings[]`: the raw layer, one finding per vulnerability in one package of one target from one scanner. Fields include `id`, `names`, `published`, `modified`, `cvss`, `severity`, `fixed_version`, `title`, `summary` (the OSV `summary`, `null` for Trivy) and `src_pkg` (the Trivy source package of an OS package, else `null`);
- `versions[]`: the vulnerability records per version;
- `ignores[]` and `ignores_error`: risk acceptance (see below);
- `acceptances[]`, only when `targets.json` has the optional `acceptances` list: the rules of the caller (see Acceptance rules below).

### versions[]

A version is all targets of one ref. Its fields: `ref`, `kind` (`development`, `release`, `candidate`), `latest` (the newest `ok` release), `status`, `targets` (target ids), `counts`, `vulns[]`, `packages[]` and `role`.

A caller whose refs are not semver tags (for example `3.1-prod`) can name the kind of a version with the optional `version_kinds` of `targets.json`: `{"<ref>": "development" | "release" | "candidate"}`. The key is the ref of a target as given, before the leading `v` is stripped; `kind` is the mapped value, else derived from the ref as above. For a mapped version `latest` is decided by `kind == "release"`, an unmapped version keeps the rule by the spelling of the ref. A ref without a target is ignored; any other value than the three kinds stops the merge with an error.

- `status` is `failed` only when a scan of one of its targets failed (Trivy, or OSV `failed`). `ok` does not mean every target was scanned: a `not_applicable` target (for example an image not published for the tag yet) does not fail the version; read the statuses in `targets[]` for the coverage. A `failed` version keeps the records and counts of its `ok` targets, so they are partial.
- `counts`: `c`, `h`, `m`, `l`, `unknown` (severities), `all` and `fixable`, computed from the `vulns[]` of the version. The unit is one vulnerability in one package.
- `vulns[]`, sorted by the key `(class, norm(pkg), id)`, where `norm(pkg)` is the package name in lowercase with each run of `-`, `_` and `.` turned into one `-`; the package version and the ref are not part of it. A record: `id`, `names`, `pkg`, `class` (`lang` for an application dependency, `os` for an image OS package), `severity`, `fixed`, `dev`, `installed`, `where` (target ids), `sources` (`trivy`, `osv`), `published` (the earliest date among the findings, or `null`), `modified` (the latest date among the findings, or `null`), `cvss` (`{score, vector, source}` of the first finding that has a score, else of the first with a vector, else `null`; scores come from Trivy only (v3 before v4, vendor order nvd, ghsa, redhat, then by name), an OSV-only record has a vector and a `null` score), `aliases` (the other ids the scanners list for it that are not in `names`, display only: never used for merging or acceptance), `ecosystem` (the OSV ecosystem name to query OSV with: the one of an OSV finding, else mapped from the Trivy type of a `lang` record, else `null`), `relationship` (`direct` over `indirect`, else the first known value, or `null`), `locations` (manifest or file paths) `accepted` (`{"until": "YYYY-MM-DD"}` or `null`), then `pkg_key`, `src_pkg` and `title` (see below). The url is not on the record: the findings of a record are those of the version's targets with the same `class`, `norm(pkg)` and an `id` that is in the record `names` (exact: every finding id is its own first name, and findings merge into a record when their names intersect).
- `packages[]`, sorted by `(class, norm(pkg))`: for every package that has a record in any version of the run, one entry per version with `pkg`, `class`, `installed` (the versions present in the targets of this version) and `where` (the target ids), then `pkg_key` and `src_pkg` (see below). The package is listed whether or not it is vulnerable in this version, so a package that is clean in one version and vulnerable in another shows what each runs. `installed` is sorted as strings, not by version. `[]` in both fields means the package is in none of the `ok` targets of the version; a `failed` or `not_applicable` target is not evidence of absence (read the statuses in `targets[]`). The source is the Trivy package lists of the `ok` targets (language and OS) plus the version's own records; a `failed` or `not_applicable` target adds nothing. Packages without any record are not listed.

Fields added to the end of the objects of `versions[]` (the new fields of `findings[]` are listed above and in the table below; nothing else of the report changed except the `.trivyignore` rule for a scan-tag run under Risk acceptance):

- `versions[].role`: `dev` for every version of kind `development`, `rc` for every `candidate`; of the `release` versions `rel` for the newest ref of the newest release line (major.minor) and `rel-1` for the newest ref of the line before it; `null` for any other version (a third line or older, a second ref of a line, a ref without major.minor).
- `pkg_key` on `vulns[]` and `packages[]`: `norm(pkg)`, the key the engine groups by (lowercase, each run of `-`, `_`, `.` as one `-`); `pkg` keeps its spelling.
- `src_pkg` on `vulns[]` and `packages[]`: the Trivy source package (`SrcName`) of an OS package, `null` for a language package or when Trivy gives none; `pkg` of an OS record stays the binary name. A record takes the value of its first Trivy finding that has one; a package the first value any of its records has.
- `title` on `vulns[]`: the Trivy `Title` of the record's findings, else the OSV `summary` (never its details), whitespace collapsed to single spaces; the first non-empty, Trivy first; `null` when there is none.

### Fields added in v0.8.0

`schema_version` stays 4: every addition is a new optional field or input; nothing is renamed, retyped or removed, and a report made without the new inputs differs from v0.7.0 only by these fields.

| Path | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `versions[].role` | string or null | `dev`, `rc`, `rel`, `rel-1` or `null`, from `kind` and the version order. |
| `versions[].vulns[].pkg_key` | string | `norm(pkg)`, the key the engine groups by. |
| `versions[].packages[].pkg_key` | string | The same for a package entry. |
| `versions[].vulns[].src_pkg` | string or null | The Trivy source package of an OS package. |
| `versions[].packages[].src_pkg` | string or null | The same for a package entry. |
| `versions[].vulns[].title` | string or null | The Trivy title, else the OSV summary. |
| `versions[].vulns[].accepted` | object or null | `{until}`, now also from an acceptance rule of the caller. |
| `acceptances[]` | list | The rules of the caller with `expired`, `bad_expiry`, `bad_rule`, `matched`; only when `targets.json` has `acceptances`. |
| `findings[].accepted` | object | `{until, reason, rule}`; only on a finding a rule accepted. |
| `findings[].summary` | string or null | The OSV `summary`; `null` for Trivy. |
| `findings[].src_pkg` | string or null | The Trivy `SrcName`; `null` otherwise. |
| `ignores_error` | string or null | `null` also when the run has no source target (images only). |

How the records are made. The findings of a version for one package merge into one record when their `names` intersect; `names` are the id and the real aliases of one vulnerability.

- Trivy: the id is `VulnerabilityID`; `names` is the id alone.
- OSV library advisories (`lang`): the id is the smallest CVE among the ids and aliases of the advisory, so a GHSA and its CVE are one record from the first day; without a CVE, the first id. `names` are the ids and aliases (CVE, GHSA, PYSEC, GO, RUSTSEC).
- OSV OS groups (`os`): one record per own CVE of the group (`UBUNTU-CVE-Y-N` reads as `CVE-Y-N`), with the fields of the member record of that CVE (a record with an Ubuntu priority is preferred). The CVEs that are only aliases of the group are not records: they are the list of a bulletin, not names of this package's vulnerabilities. A group of bulletins alone (`USN-...`) gives one record with the bulletin id and severity `UNKNOWN`.
- Severity: the worst Trivy rating among the record's findings, else the worst OSV rating. An OSV-only `os` record takes the Ubuntu priority of its member (`negligible` as `LOW`); other distributions give no priority, so `UNKNOWN`.
- `fixed` joins the fixed versions of the findings (Trivy first); `dev` is true only when every finding is for a development-only package.

## Risk acceptance

The engine reads the `.trivyignore` of the default branch (else of the only source target of the run, so a run whose source is a version reads it too: a scan-tag run honours the `.trivyignore` of that tag without any new input, which is an intended change of v0.8.0) and marks the records of every version; no finding is removed, and the scheduled scan itself does not apply ignores. The workflow passes the file and states `ignorefile` (`present`, `absent`, or `null` when the checkout failed) in the `status.json` of that source target.

- The grammar is the plain Trivy one: the first field of a line is the id, the first `exp:YYYY-MM-DD` counts, a line with a bad date does not act (the file as a whole is still read), a comment is a whole line starting with `#`, blank lines are skipped.
- `reason`: the text of the comment lines directly above a line (leading `#` and spaces dropped, joined by a space), `null` when there is none. A blank line or another ignore line ends the block. It is information for readers and never acts.
- A line accepts a record only with an acting `exp:` (the date is after the day of the run; on the day itself it no longer acts), and only when its id equals the `id` or one of the `names` of the record. It matches in every version of the run. The matching is by id and names only, so it can be wider than the Trivy gate itself: purl and path scoping on a line is not applied.
- Intended differences from Trivy: a line without `exp:` is not an acceptance here (Trivy ignores such a vulnerability forever); when several lines name one vulnerability, the earliest acting date wins (Trivy takes the first match).
- `ignores[]`: per line `id`, `until`, `expired`, `bad_expiry`, `no_expiry`, `matched` (the line matched a record of any version) and `reason`.
- `ignores_error` is `null` (with `ignores` `null` too when the run has no source target at all, for example images only), or the reason `ignores` is `null` (no `.trivyignore` line accepts a record then): `the workflow does not pass the ignore file`, `no readable status file for <id>` (the `status.json` of the default-branch source target is missing, unreadable or not a JSON object), `unexpected ignorefile value: ...`, `checkout failed`, `no default-branch target in this run` (several source targets and none on the default branch), or the file could not be read.
- `.trivyignore.yaml` is not read.

### Acceptance rules

A caller that keeps its risk decisions outside the repository adds an optional `acceptances` list to `targets.json` before the merge. Each rule has `targets` (ids of Trivy targets, source or image), `package`, optional `class` (`os` or `lang`: only that kind of package), `ids` (optional list of vulnerability ids; missing or empty: every vulnerability of the package), `expires` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and `reason`; other keys (for example `approved_by`, `ticket`, `scope`) are passed through unchanged. The engine sets no policy on the date (no limit on how far it is) and does not validate the rules file as a whole; a rule with a missing or unreal date is flagged and does not act. A rule of the wrong shape (`package` not a string, `targets` not a list of strings, `ids` present but not a list of strings, `class` present but not a string, or an entry that is not a mapping) is kept in `acceptances[]` with `bad_rule: true`, never acts, and does not stop the report; an entry that is not a mapping is kept under `rule`.

- A rule acts until the day of its `expires` (UTC, the date of the report; on the day itself it no longer acts). A package matches as the merge groups it: a `lang` package by `norm(pkg)`, an `os` package by its exact name. With `ids`, a finding matches when any of the names of its merged vulnerability (the findings of the same target, package and version whose names intersect) is listed, so an OSV id accepts the Trivy finding of the same vulnerability too.
- A matching finding gets `accepted`: `{until, reason, rule}`, where `rule` is the index in `acceptances[]`. Several rules: the earliest `expires` wins. No finding is removed.
- A record of `versions[].vulns[]` gets `accepted: {until}` only when every finding of the record is accepted by rules; when a `.trivyignore` line names the record too, the earliest `until` of the two wins.
- `acceptances[]` is every rule as given plus `expired`, `bad_expiry`, `bad_rule` and `matched` (the findings it accepted). The summary lists expired rules, rules with a bad date, malformed rules and rules that matched nothing under `Acceptance rules`. `ignores[]` is not touched by rules.
- Without `acceptances` in `targets.json` the report has no `acceptances` key and is unchanged.

## Versioning

Releases are git tags `vX.Y.Z`. v0.8.0 keeps schema 4 and only adds to it (see Fields added in v0.8.0; the changes are listed in `CHANGELOG.md`). Schema 4 itself was a breaking change in v0.7.0: the `counts` block is gone (the numbers are in `versions[].counts`), and `findings[]` changed too: a Trivy finding's id is `VulnerabilityID` (no longer the lowest CVE among `VulnerabilityID` and `VendorIDs`); an OSV `os` group gives one finding per own CVE with that member's Ubuntu priority, fixes and date (was one finding per group with the group's CVSS bucket); a bulletin-only group gives one `UNKNOWN` finding with the smallest bulletin id. Consumers therefore branch on `schema_version`. Consumers pin a tag, for example:

```yml
- uses: epam/ai-dial-sec-sca/actions/sca_merge_results@v0.8.0
```

The third-party actions are pinned by commit SHA and osv-scanner by the sha256 of its binary (in `actions/sca_query_osv/action.yml`). Trivy is pinned by version only: the install checks the download against the checksums published with the same release, not against a value pinned here.
